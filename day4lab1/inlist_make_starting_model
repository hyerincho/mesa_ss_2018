! inlist_make_starting_model

! 2nd inlist loads 'pre_ms.mod', changes parameters as desired, and runs until reach L limit.
! this is the time to change uniform composition to approximate the target
! and set other things such as 'which_atm_option'.
! the stopping L is set to select a model that is near the end of fully convective contraction.
! since it is fully convective, we can safely make changes to uniform composition.
! the final model is saved to 'astero_test.mod' for use by 'inlist_astero'.
