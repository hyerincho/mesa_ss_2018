This is the top-level test directory for GYRE. The tests in the
following subdirectories are designed both to test that GYRE is
working correctly, and to demonstrate how to perform different types
of calculation using GYRE.

ad    -- adiabatic pulsations
nad   -- nonadiabatic pulsations
num   -- numerics

The other subdirectories are used internally for testing and
development purposes.
